It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Executive Leadership (Ministry Directors & Deputy Ministers):**
- Senior government officials (45-60 years old) with 15+ years experience
- Responsible for multiple project portfolios worth $50M+ annually
- Focus on strategic oversight rather than operational details
- Need real-time visibility into portfolio health without operational details
- Require natural language summaries for quick decision-making

**Portfolio & Program Managers:**
- Mid-career professionals (30-50 years old) with PMP certification
- Managing 5-15 projects simultaneously with technical background
- Need cross-project dependency visualization and impact analysis
- Require automated risk assessment and prioritization
- Focus on compliance monitoring against PMI standards

**Project Officers:**
- Operational staff responsible for day-to-day project execution
- Need detailed task tracking and issue resolution tools
- Require clear compliance guidance and standards alignment
- Focus on task completion and risk mitigation at project level

#### Usability Goals

- **Ease of learning:** New users can navigate to their role-specific dashboard within 2 minutes
- **Efficiency of use:** Portfolio managers can assess risk across 10+ projects within 5 minutes
- **Error prevention:** Clear validation for compliance requirements with automated suggestions
- **Memorability:** Infrequent executive users can understand portfolio health at a glance
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance ensures all government users can access the system

#### Design Principles

1. **Clarity over complexity** - Prioritize clear communication of complex AI insights through intuitive visualizations
2. **Role-appropriate information density** - Progressive disclosure from executive summaries to detailed analysis
3. **Data-driven authority** - Professional government aesthetic that conveys trust and reliability
4. **Proactive risk communication** - Visual risk indicators that enable early intervention
5. **Accessible by design** - WCAG AA compliance integrated throughout all interface elements

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Hierarchical breadcrumbs showing Dashboard > Section > Sub-section with clickable navigation

### User Flows

#### Executive Portfolio Review Flow

**User Goal:** Quickly assess overall portfolio health and identify high-risk projects requiring attention

**Entry Points:** Executive Dashboard landing page, email notifications for critical risks

**Success Criteria:** Executive can identify top 3 risk areas and understand recommended actions within 3 minutes

```mermaid

    E --> G[Access Natural Language Summary]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Review AI Recommendations]
    H --> I[Make Strategic Decisions]
    I --> J[Share Insights with Team]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- No data available: Show helpful onboarding with data integration status
- System maintenance: Graceful degradation with cached data and maintenance notifications
- Permission errors: Clear messaging about access restrictions with escalation options

**Notes:** Executive flow prioritizes speed and clarity over detailed analysis

#### Portfolio Manager Risk Assessment Flow

**User Goal:** Comprehensive risk assessment across multiple projects with dependency analysis

**Entry Points:** Portfolio Manager Dashboard, risk notification alerts, scheduled review sessions

**Success Criteria:** Complete risk assessment of 10+ projects with dependency mapping within 15 minutes
