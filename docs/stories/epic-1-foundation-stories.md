  - apps/api/package.json (updated dependencies)
  - package.json (updated with Playwright scripts and dependencies)
  - apps/web/src/tests/setup.ts (test setup configuration)
  - apps/web/src/tests/test-utils.tsx (test utilities and mock factories)
  - playwright.config.ts (Playwright E2E configuration)
  - e2e/auth.spec.ts (sample E2E tests)
  - .github/workflows/test.yml (CI/CD workflow)
- **Change Log:**
  - Upgraded all dependencies to latest versions including Vite 6.0.1
  - Configured Vitest with TypeScript support and coverage reporting
  - Set up Testing Library with custom render utilities
  - Created Playwright configuration for E2E testing
  - Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
  - Created mock services and test data factories
  - All existing tests passing (25/25)
- **Status:** Ready for Review

#### Story 1.6.2: CI/CD Pipeline
**Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up CI/CD pipelines so that we can automate testing and deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] GitHub Actions configured for CI
- [ ] Automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Build and deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Security scanning integrated
- [ ] Performance testing setup
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedures

**Technical Details:**
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows for different environments
- Set up Vercel deployment integration
- Implement security scanning with CodeQL
- Create performance testing with Lighthouse CI

**Dependencies:** Story 1.1.1, Story 1.6.1

## Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Required for Epic 2
- [ ] All data models (Project, Portfolio, Risk, User)
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Basic frontend framework
- [ ] Convex backend functions

### Required for Epic 3
- [ ] Project and Portfolio data models
- [ ] Basic dashboard framework
- [ ] User role management

### Required for Epic 4
- [ ] Risk data model
- [ ] Project data for AI predictions
- [ ] Backend function framework

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Government SSO Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with mock authentication for development
   - **Fallback:** Basic username/password for initial testing

2. **Convex Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive documentation and examples
   - **Fallback:** Traditional REST API approach if needed

3. **Monorepo Management**
   - **Mitigation:** Clear package boundaries and dependency rules
   - **Fallback:** Separate repositories if complexity becomes unmanageable

### Timeline Risks
1. **Data Model Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable data models
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Authentication Integration Delays**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock authentication
   - **Contingency:** Government integration can be completed in Epic 2

## Definition of Done

### For Each Story
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### For Epic 1 Completion
- [ ] All stories completed and tested
- [ ] End-to-end testing successful
- [ ] Development environment stable
- [ ] Basic authentication working
- [ ] Core data models functional
- [ ] Ready for Epic 2 development

## Next Steps After Epic 1

1. **Immediate:** Begin Epic 2 development (Role-Based Dashboard Framework)
2. **Quality:** Code review and technical debt assessment
3. **Documentation:** Update architecture and setup guides
4. **Testing:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing
