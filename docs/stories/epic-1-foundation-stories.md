## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Government SSO Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with mock authentication for development
   - **Fallback:** Basic username/password for initial testing

2. **Convex Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive documentation and examples
   - **Fallback:** Traditional REST API approach if needed

3. **Monorepo Management**
   - **Mitigation:** Clear package boundaries and dependency rules
   - **Fallback:** Separate repositories if complexity becomes unmanageable

### Timeline Risks
1. **Data Model Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable data models
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Authentication Integration Delays**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock authentication
   - **Contingency:** Government integration can be completed in Epic 2

## Definition of Done

### For Each Story
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### For Epic 1 Completion
- [ ] All stories completed and tested
- [ ] End-to-end testing successful
- [ ] Development environment stable
- [ ] Basic authentication working
- [ ] Core data models functional
- [ ] Ready for Epic 2 development

## Next Steps After Epic 1

1. **Immediate:** Begin Epic 2 development (Role-Based Dashboard Framework)
2. **Quality:** Code review and technical debt assessment
3. **Documentation:** Update architecture and setup guides
4. **Testing:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing
