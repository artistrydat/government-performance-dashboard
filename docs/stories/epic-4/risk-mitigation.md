# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
1. **AI Service Reliability**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling and fallbacks
   - **Fallback:** Mock prediction service for development

2. **Prediction Accuracy**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement confidence scoring and validation
   - **Fallback:** Human review of critical predictions

3. **Performance with Real-time Predictions**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement caching and batch processing
   - **Fallback:** Scheduled updates instead of real-time

## Timeline Risks
1. **AI Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic predictions, enhance progressively
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Model Training Requirements**
   - **Mitigation:** Use pre-trained models initially
   - **Contingency:** Focus on rule-based predictions if needed
