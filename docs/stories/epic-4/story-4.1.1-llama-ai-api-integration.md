# Story 4.1.1: Llama AI API Integration

## Story Details
**Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Llama AI models so that we can generate AI predictions for project risks.

**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 2 days  
**Assigned To:** James (Developer)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Llama AI API client implementation
- [x] Authentication and rate limiting configuration
- [x] Request/response handling with error management
- [x] Model selection and configuration
- [x] API key management and security
- [x] Mock service for development and testing
- [x] Unit tests for AI integration

## Technical Details

### Implementation Summary

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `apps/api/convex/aiService.ts` - Main AI service implementation
- `apps/api/convex/schema.ts` - Added ai_predictions table
- `apps/api/tests/ai-service.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **Dual Mode Operation:**
   - Real Llama AI API integration when `LLAMA_API_KEY` is provided
   - Mock service for development and testing
   - Automatic fallback to mock service in development mode

2. **Prediction Types Supported:**
   - Failure prediction with confidence scoring
   - Timeline delay prediction
   - Budget overrun risk assessment
   - Compliance risk correlation

3. **Security & Rate Limiting:**
   - Authentication required for all AI requests
   - Rate limiting configuration (60 requests/minute)
   - Secure API key management via environment variables

4. **Error Handling & Resilience:**
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries)
   - Graceful degradation to mock service
   - Comprehensive error logging and reporting

### API Integration Details

**Real AI Service:**
- Uses Llama AI REST API with bearer token authentication
- Supports model selection and configuration
- Implements proper request/response serialization
- Includes retry logic for rate limiting and network issues

**Mock Service:**
- Realistic mock predictions for all prediction types
- Simulated API delays and response patterns
- Consistent confidence scoring and reasoning
- Actionable recommendations based on prediction type

### Database Schema

Added `ai_predictions` table with:
- Type (failure, delay, budget, compliance)
- Confidence score (0-1)
- Predicted value and time horizon
- Reasoning and recommendations
- Model used and generation timestamp
- Active/inactive status management

### Testing Coverage

**Unit Tests Include:**
- Mock prediction generation for all types
- Model availability and health checks
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Error handling and fallback scenarios
- Realistic prediction validation

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

### File List
**New Files:**
- `apps/api/convex/aiService.ts` - Main AI service implementation
- `apps/api/tests/ai-service.test.ts` - Unit tests for AI service

**Modified Files:**
- `apps/api/convex/schema.ts` - Added ai_predictions table

### Change Log
- **2025-11-01 21:25** - Created initial AI service implementation
- **2025-11-01 21:28** - Added database schema for ai_predictions
- **2025-11-01 21:29** - Fixed TypeScript errors in service
- **2025-11-01 21:30** - Created comprehensive unit tests

## Testing

### Unit Tests
All unit tests passing with comprehensive coverage:
- Mock prediction generation for all types
- Model availability and health checks
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Error handling scenarios
- Production fallback behavior

### Integration Points
- Successfully integrates with existing Convex backend
- Compatible with existing project data models
- Ready for use by frontend dashboard components

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Story 4.1.2** - Implement AI Prediction Data Model
2. **Frontend Integration** - Create React hooks for AI service
3. **Environment Setup** - Configure production API keys

### Dependencies for Future Stories
- This service provides foundation for all AI prediction features
- Ready for integration with prediction engine (Story 4.2.1)
- Compatible with batch processing (Story 4.2.2)

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- TypeScript implementation with proper typing
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Clean separation of concerns between real/mock services
- Proper environment variable management

### Security
- Authentication required for all AI requests
- Secure API key storage and usage
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
