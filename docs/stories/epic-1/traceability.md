# Traceability: Epic 1 → Story 1.6.2 CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This traceability document maps Story 1.6.2: CI/CD Pipeline to its epic context, dependencies, and related artifacts to ensure end-to-end alignment and auditability.

## Story Reference
- Epic: Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- Story: 1.6.2: CI/CD Pipeline
- Shard Reference: docs/stories/epic-1/shards/story-1.6.2-ci-cd-pipeline.md

## Dependencies and Alignment
- Dependency: 1.1.1 (Phase 1.1.1 – Monorepo Setup)
  - Rationale: Establishes the monorepo layout and package boundaries required for CI/CD scaffolding.
- Dependency: 1.6.1 (Phase 1.6.1 – Testing Framework Setup)
  - Rationale: Ensures test suites and coverage tooling are in place to be integrated into CI pipelines.

## Related Artifacts
- Shard: docs/stories/epic-1/shards/story-1.6.2-ci-cd-pipeline.md
- Epic Landing: docs/stories/epic-1/index.md (now references the CI/CD shard)
- CI/CD Plan Artifacts (to be created as workflows and configs):
  - GitHub Actions workflows under .github/workflows
  - Vercel deployment integration steps
  - CodeQL security scanning steps
  - Lighthouse CI performance checks

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- GitHub Actions configured for CI
  - Ensure workflow files are defined for CI on pull requests and pushes.
- Automated testing on pull requests
  - Align with Story 1.6.1 testing framework setup.
- Build and deployment to staging environment
  - Include steps to build and deploy to a staging environment (e.g., Vercel/Preview)
- Security scanning integrated
  - Incorporate CodeQL or equivalent scanning in PR checks.
- Performance testing setup
  - Integrate Lighthouse CI or similar performance tooling.
- Deployment rollback procedures
  - Implement rollback strategy (scripts or environment toggles) for failed deployments.

## Implementation Plan (high level)
1) Create GitHub Actions workflows under .github/workflows for CI, PR checks, and deployment to staging.
2) Integrate Vercel deployment steps to publish staging builds automatically.
3) Add CodeQL scanning steps to security-scan the codebase on PRs and main.
4) Configure Lighthouse CI steps to run after staging builds for performance metrics.
5) Add rollback/rollback procedures to handle failed deployments (rollback scripts and/or environment toggles).
6) Document the workflow and update the epic shard index for traceability.

## Status
- Draft (ready for implementation planning and execution)

## Owner
- James (Full Stack Developer)
