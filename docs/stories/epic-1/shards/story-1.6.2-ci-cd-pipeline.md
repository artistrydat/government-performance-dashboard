# Story 1.6.2: CI/CD Pipeline

## Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up CI/CD pipelines so that we can automate testing and deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions configured for CI
- [ ] Automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Build and deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Security scanning integrated
- [ ] Performance testing setup
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedures

## Technical Details
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows for different environments
- Set up Vercel deployment integration
- Implement security scanning with CodeQL
- Create performance testing with Lighthouse CI

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1.1
- Story 1.6.1

## Rationale / Notes
- This shard captures the CI/CD workflow decisions and ensures alignment with the Testing Framework setup (Story 1.6.1) to enable end-to-end automation.

## Implementation Plan (high level)
1. Create GitHub Actions workflows under .github/workflows for CI, PR checks, and deployment to staging.
2. Integrate Vercel deployment steps to publish staging builds automatically.
3. Add CodeQL scanning steps to security-scan the codebase on PRs and main.
4. Configure Lighthouse CI steps to run after staging builds for performance metrics.
5. Add rollback/rollback procedures to handle failed deployments (rollback scripts and/or environment toggles).
6. Document the workflow and update the epic shard index for traceability.
