# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
1. **Government SSO Integration Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with mock authentication for development
   - **Fallback:** Basic username/password for initial testing

2. **Convex Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive documentation and examples
   - **Fallback:** Traditional REST API approach if needed

3. **Monorepo Management**
   - **Mitigation:** Clear package boundaries and dependency rules
   - **Fallback:** Separate repositories if complexity becomes unmanageable

## Timeline Risks
1. **Data Model Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable data models
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Authentication Integration Delays**
   - **Mitigation:** Parallel development with mock authentication
   - **Contingency:** Government integration can be completed in Epic 2
