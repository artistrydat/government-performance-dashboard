# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
1. **Advanced Algorithm Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with proven algorithms, enhance progressively
   - **Fallback:** Basic versions if advanced algorithms prove too complex

2. **Performance Optimization Challenges**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement gradual optimization with monitoring
   - **Fallback:** Accept current performance if optimization proves difficult

3. **Continuous Learning Implementation**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simple feedback loops, enhance later
   - **Fallback:** Manual model updates if automated learning fails

## Timeline Risks
1. **Optimization Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on high-impact optimizations first
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 2-3 days if needed

2. **Advanced Feature Development**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement core features first, advanced features later
   - **Contingency:** Defer some advanced features to post-MVP
