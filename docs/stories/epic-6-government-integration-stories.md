## Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Required from Epic 1
- [x] All data models (Project, Portfolio, Risk, User)
- [x] Authentication system
- [x] Basic frontend framework
- [x] Convex backend functions

### Required from Epic 4
- [x] AI predictions for enhanced data analysis
- [x] Prediction engine for government data

### Required for Epic 7
- [ ] Government data for advanced AI features
- [ ] Integration framework for continuous learning

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Government System API Changes**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement flexible adapter patterns
   - **Fallback:** Manual data import if APIs change

2. **Data Volume and Performance**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement pagination and incremental sync
   - **Fallback:** Batch processing instead of real-time

3. **Security and Compliance**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement government-grade security protocols
   - **Fallback:** Reduced data scope if security requirements too complex

### Timeline Risks
1. **Government System Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with simpler systems, expand progressively
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Authentication Protocol Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Use standard protocols where possible
   - **Contingency:** Basic authentication if complex protocols fail
