# Epic 2: Role-Based Dashboard Framework - Scrum Master & Story Structure Review

## Executive Summary

**Review Date:** 10/25/2025  
**Reviewer:** Cline (Software Engineer)  
**Overall Assessment:** **READY FOR STORY CREATION** with minor recommendations

### Key Findings
- Scrum Master agent definition is well-structured and aligned with Epic 2 requirements
- Epic 2 story structure is comprehensive with clear sequencing and dependencies
- No blocking issues identified - ready for story creation using `create-next-story` procedure
- Minor optimization opportunities for enhanced clarity and efficiency

## Scrum Master Agent Review

### Strengths

1. **Clear Role Definition**: The Scrum Master agent has a well-defined purpose focused on story creation and agile process guidance
2. **Proper Constraints**: Explicitly prevents code implementation, maintaining role boundaries
3. **Dependency Management**: Well-structured dependencies with appropriate tasks, checklists, and templates
4. **Process Adherence**: Rigorous `create-next-story` procedure ensures consistency
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in story validation through checklists

### Alignment with Epic 2 Requirements

| Epic 2 Requirement | Scrum Master Capability | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Story sequencing across 6 phases | `create-next-story` procedure | ✅ Excellent |
| Technical implementation guidance | Architecture document integration | ✅ Strong |
| Role-based dashboard complexity | Story template structure | ✅ Appropriate |
| Real-time data requirements | Technical context gathering | ✅ Supported |
| Cross-epic dependencies | Dependency analysis in workflow | ✅ Comprehensive |

### Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Story Validation**: Consider adding specific validation for dashboard-specific requirements (real-time updates, role-based access)
2. **Performance Considerations**: Include performance benchmarks in story acceptance criteria where relevant
3. **Accessibility Integration**: Ensure WCAG AA compliance is explicitly addressed in UI stories

## Epic 2 Story Structure Analysis

### Completeness Assessment

| Category | Status | Assessment |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Story Sequencing** | ✅ Complete | 6 phases with clear dependencies and durations |
| **Technical Requirements** | ✅ Comprehensive | Detailed acceptance criteria and technical specifications |
| **Dependency Management** | ✅ Thorough | Cross-epic dependencies clearly documented |
| **Risk Mitigation** | ✅ Proactive | Technical and timeline risks identified with mitigation strategies |
| **Definition of Done** | ✅ Clear | Comprehensive criteria for story and epic completion |
| **Next Steps** | ✅ Forward-looking | Clear transition plan to Epic 3 |

### Story Quality Assessment

Using the Story Draft Checklist criteria:

#### 1. Goal & Context Clarity
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Assessment:** All stories clearly state WHAT to build and WHY it's valuable
- **Strengths:** Clear user stories, explicit business value, role-specific context

#### 2. Technical Implementation Guidance
- **Status:** ✅ PASS  
- **Assessment:** Sufficient technical details for developer implementation
- **Strengths:** Specific technology references, component specifications, integration points

#### 3. Reference Effectiveness
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Assessment:** Architecture and PRD provide comprehensive context
- **Strengths:** Clear data models, API specifications, component patterns

#### 4. Self-Containment Assessment
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Assessment:** Stories can be understood with minimal external context
- **Strengths:** Complete acceptance criteria, technical specifications, testing requirements

#### 5. Testing Guidance
- **Status:** ✅ PASS
- **Assessment:** Clear testing requirements and validation criteria
- **Strengths:** Unit test specifications, integration testing, performance benchmarks

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks (Epic 2)
1. **Performance with Real-time Data** - Adequately mitigated with optimization strategies
2. **Complex Visualization Requirements** - Appropriate fallback mechanisms defined
3. **Role-Based Complexity** - Clear separation strategy implemented

#### Process Risks
1. **Story Creation Workflow** - Scrum Master procedure well-defined and tested
2. **Dependency Management** - Cross-epic dependencies clearly documented
3. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive Definition of Done established

## Recommendations for Optimization

### Immediate Actions (Before Story Creation)

1. **Verify Architecture Integration**
   - Confirm all Epic 2 components align with architecture specifications
   - Validate data model compatibility with existing Epic 1 structures

2. **Update Story Template References**
   - Ensure story template includes specific dashboard-related sections
   - Add real-time data update patterns to technical guidance

3. **Enhance Performance Benchmarks**
   - Include specific performance targets in relevant stories (2.5.2, 2.2.1, etc.)
   - Add load testing requirements for dashboard components

### Process Improvements

1. **Scrum Master Workflow Enhancement**
   - Consider adding dashboard-specific validation checklist items
   - Include accessibility compliance verification in UI stories

2. **Story Quality Gates**
   - Implement pre-implementation review for complex dashboard stories
   - Add performance impact assessment for real-time features

### Technical Considerations

1. **Real-time Data Strategy**
   - Ensure Convex subscriptions are properly scoped for each dashboard
   - Implement optimistic updates for better user experience

2. **Role-Based Access Implementation**
   - Verify route protection aligns with architecture specifications
   - Test permission boundaries across all three user roles

## Implementation Readiness

### Story Creation Priority

**Phase 2.1 Stories (Highest Priority):**
1. **2.1.1: Main Dashboard Layout** - Foundation for all subsequent stories
2. **2.1.2: Role-Based Navigation** - Critical for role-specific functionality

**Recommended Story Creation Order:**
1. 2.1.1 → 2.1.2 → 2.2.1 → 2.2.2 → 2.3.1 → 2.3.2 → 2.4.1 → 2.4.2 → 2.5.1 → 2.5.2 → 2.6.1

### Dependencies Verification

**Epic 1 Dependencies:** ✅ All confirmed complete based on cross-epic dependencies
- Data models (Project, Portfolio, Risk, User)
- Authentication system
- Basic frontend framework
- Convex backend functions

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The Scrum Master agent definition and Epic 2 story structure demonstrate excellent alignment and comprehensive planning. The story sequencing is logical, technical requirements are well-specified, and risk mitigation strategies are appropriate.

**Next Steps:**
1. Activate Scrum Master agent (`@sm`)
2. Execute `*draft` command to create first story (2.1.1)
3. Follow sequential story creation through all 6 phases
4. Monitor implementation against Definition of Done criteria

The foundation is solid for successful Epic 2 implementation with clear guidance for both human and AI-driven development workflows.
