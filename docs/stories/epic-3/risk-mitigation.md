# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks
1. **PMI Standards Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with core PMI standards, expand progressively
   - **Fallback:** Focus on critical standards first, add others later

2. **Performance with Large Evidence Sets**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement pagination and lazy loading
   - **Fallback:** Batch processing for evidence validation

3. **PDF Generation Performance**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement server-side PDF generation
   - **Fallback:** Client-side generation with performance optimization

## Timeline Risks
1. **PMI Standards Implementation Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Use simplified standards model initially
   - **Contingency:** Extend timeline by 3-4 days if needed

2. **Evidence Management Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic evidence types, expand later
   - **Contingency:** Focus on critical evidence requirements first
