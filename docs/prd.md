# AI-Powered Government Performance Management Dashboard Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce government project failure rate by 40% within 12 months
- Decrease manual compliance checking time by 75% (from 20-30% to 5-7% of PM time)
- Achieve 90% user adoption across pilot ministry
- Generate $15M in cost savings through early risk detection
- Provide 95% accurate AI predictions for project failures 3 months in advance
- Enable proactive governance through real-time portfolio visibility

### Background Context
Government ministries currently face significant challenges with manual project monitoring using spreadsheets and periodic reports, leading to delayed risk detection and reactive crisis management. The current system results in budget overruns averaging 15-25% and schedule delays of 3-6 months. This solution transforms project oversight through AI-powered predictive capabilities, automated PMI standards compliance monitoring, and role-based dashboards tailored for executive leadership, portfolio managers, and project officers. The system addresses the critical gap in existing solutions by combining predictive AI with government-specific compliance requirements and real-time data integration.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A professional, data-driven interface that conveys authority and trustworthiness while making complex AI insights accessible to government stakeholders. The design should prioritize clarity over visual complexity, with intuitive navigation and role-appropriate information density. The system should feel like a strategic command center rather than an operational tool.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Progressive disclosure of information - high-level summaries for executives, detailed analysis for portfolio managers
- Visual risk communication through color coding and intuitive data visualization
- Natural language interaction via AI chat for complex queries
- Contextual help and guidance integrated throughout the interface
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go decision making

### Core Screens and Views
- Executive Dashboard: High-level portfolio health overview with natural language summaries and strategic health indicators
- Portfolio Manager Dashboard: Risk heat maps, dependency network graphs, and resource optimization views
- Project Detail View: Comprehensive project analysis with AI insights, compliance status, and risk timeline
- Compliance Center: PMI standards monitoring with automated audit reports and compliance scoring
- AI Chat Interface: Interactive panel for compliance queries and standards alignment assistance

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The interface must meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for all government users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. This includes proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and clear focus indicators.

### Branding
Professional government aesthetic with a clean, authoritative design language. Use official government color schemes where available, with a focus on readability and accessibility. The interface should convey trust, reliability, and data-driven decision making.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary platform is web-responsive design accessible via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The system must provide optimal experience across all devices while maintaining full functionality.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing frontend, backend, AI models, and infrastructure as code to maintain consistency and simplify dependency management across the integrated system components.

### Service Architecture
Microservices architecture with separate services for AI prediction engine, compliance monitoring, data integration, and user interface. AI agent servers will be hosted externally, separate from the main application servers, to maintain modularity, scalability, and compliance with data governance policies.

### Testing Requirements
Full Testing Pyramid including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. AI models require specialized testing with historical data validation. Compliance monitoring requires automated regression testing against PMI standards.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Frontend:** Vite with React/TypeScript, Zustand for state management, TanStack Query for data synchronization, DaisyUI for responsive design system
- **Backend:** Convex for real-time, reactive data architecture with complex multi-level data relationships
- **AI Integration:** Llama models for AI agent, hosted externally with controlled API integrations
- **Integration:** REST APIs for government system integration, real-time data streaming, secure authentication (OAuth2/SAML)
- **Security:** Government-grade encryption, audit logging, role-based access control, data classification, compliance with national security standards
- **Performance:** Sub-3 second load times for dashboard views, real-time data updates within 5 seconds, support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Standards:** PMI standards and frameworks for portfolio, program, and project management
