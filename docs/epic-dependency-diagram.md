## Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Shared Components Timeline
| Component | Created In Epic | Used By Epics | Critical Path |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Authentication System** | Epic 1 | All epics | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Data Models** | Epic 1 | All epics | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Dashboard Framework** | Epic 2 | Epic 3, 4, 5, 7 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Compliance Engine** | Epic 3 | Epic 4, 5, 7 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **AI Prediction Service** | Epic 4 | Epic 5, 6, 7 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Government API Adapters** | Epic 6 | Epic 7 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional |

### Integration Points
1. **Epic 1 ‚Üí Epic 2:** Authentication + Dashboard framework
2. **Epic 2 ‚Üí Epic 3:** Dashboard + Compliance monitoring
3. **Epic 3 ‚Üí Epic 4:** Compliance data + AI predictions
4. **Epic 4 ‚Üí Epic 5:** Predictions + Advanced visualization
5. **Epic 4 ‚Üí Epic 6:** AI insights + Government data
6. **Epic 5 ‚Üí Epic 7:** Analytics + Advanced AI features

## Risk Mitigation for Sequencing

### Critical Path Risks
1. **Epic 1 Delays:** Would block all subsequent epics
   - **Mitigation:** Keep Epic 1 scope minimal, focus on core infrastructure only
   
2. **AI Integration Complexity (Epic 4):** Could impact Epic 5 and Epic 7
   - **Mitigation:** Implement fallback mock AI service for development

3. **Government System Integration (Epic 6):** External dependency risk
   - **Mitigation:** Develop with mock government APIs initially

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Epic 5 and Epic 6** can be developed in parallel once Epic 4 is complete
- **Epic 7** can start once core AI features in Epic 4 are stable
- Frontend components can be developed alongside backend services

## External Service Sequencing

### Llama AI Integration
**Phase:** Epic 4
**Prerequisites:**
- Core data models (Epic 1)
- Basic dashboard framework (Epic 2)
- Compliance data structure (Epic 3)

**Setup Sequence:**
1. Provider selection and account setup
2. API key configuration and secure storage
3. Development environment integration
4. Production deployment configuration

### Government System Integration  
**Phase:** Epic 6
**Prerequisites:**
- Core authentication (Epic 1)
- AI prediction service (Epic 4)
- Data transformation pipelines

**Setup Sequence:**
1. Government system API documentation review
2. Authentication protocol implementation
3. Data mapping and transformation logic
4. Integration testing with government systems

## Validation Against PO Master Checklist

### ‚úÖ Resolved Critical Issues
1. **Feature Sequencing Ambiguity** - Clear epic dependencies defined
2. **User Flow Progression** - Explicit user journey sequencing
3. **Cross-Epic Dependencies** - Comprehensive dependency matrix

### ‚úÖ Addressed Quality Improvements
1. **Package Management** - Monorepo structure with Turborepo
2. **Migration Strategy** - Data evolution handled in Epic 1
3. **API Failure Handling** - Fallback mechanisms for external services

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Begin Epic 1 development with this sequencing plan
2. **Short-term:** Create detailed stories for Epic 1 following this dependency structure
3. **Ongoing:** Use this diagram for sprint planning and dependency management
