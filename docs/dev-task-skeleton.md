# Dev Task Skeleton

This document provides a reusable skeleton for implementing development tasks within the BMad workflow. It outlines a concrete, repeatable sequence from task identification to validation and handoff.

## Starter TODO LIST (for this session)

- [ ] Determine the next task to tackle
- [ ] Create a task skeleton with subtasks
- [ ] Implement the code changes for the chosen task
- [ ] Add tests covering new behavior
- [ ] Run linting and tests
- [ ] Update the Dev Agent Record sections in the story file (Completion Notes, File List as needed)
- [ ] Confirm validations pass and prepare for the next task

## Starter options (choose by number or provide your own task)

1) Start a new dev task skeleton for a small feature (with subtasks and a basic test plan)
2) Scan the repository for quick wins (lint issues, minor refactors, or test gaps) and propose concrete changes
3) Create a minimal end-to-end dev task using the develop-story workflow (order-of-execution included) and execute it end-to-end
4) Provide your own task or share a PRD/architecture note to drive the implementation

## Typical execution flow (high level)

- Step 1: Identify the next task to work on (or accept an input PRD/architecture note)
- Step 2: Build a concrete task skeleton with clear subtasks
- Step 3: Implement the code changes for the chosen task
- Step 4: Create or update tests covering new behavior
- Step 5: Run linting, unit/integration tests, and validations
- Step 6: If validations pass, update the Dev Agent Record in the story
- Step 7: Document changes and prepare for the next task
