# AI-Powered Government Performance Management Dashboard Fullstack Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for AI-Powered Government Performance Management Dashboard, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Analysis:** The PRD specifies a monorepo structure and specific technology stack (Vite/React/TypeScript, Convex, Llama AI models). This appears to be a greenfield project with specific technology preferences rather than using a pre-built starter template.

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project with specific technology requirements

**Constraints:**
- Must use Vite + React/TypeScript for frontend
- Must use Convex for backend data architecture
- Must integrate external Llama AI models
- Must support Arabic/English localization
- Must meet government security and performance requirements

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

This architecture implements a microservices-based fullstack application using Vite/React/TypeScript for the frontend and Convex for real-time backend data management. The system integrates external Llama AI models for predictive analytics while maintaining government-grade security and data sovereignty. Frontend deployment uses Vercel for optimal performance, while backend services leverage Convex's reactive data architecture for real-time updates. The monorepo structure ensures consistency across all components while enabling modular development of AI prediction, compliance monitoring, and data integration services.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Rationale:**
- **Vercel** provides optimal frontend performance with global CDN and edge functions
- **Convex** offers real-time reactive data architecture ideal for dashboard applications
- **External AI hosting** maintains modularity and compliance with data governance policies
- **Government authentication service** ensures compliance with security standards

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo with package-based organization
**Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo for build optimization and task orchestration
**Package Organization:** Apps (web, api), Packages (shared, ui, config), Infrastructure (IaC)

### Architectural Patterns

- **Microservices Architecture:** Separate services for AI prediction, compliance monitoring, and data integration - _Rationale:_ Enables independent scaling and maintenance of complex AI and compliance features
- **Component-Based UI:** Reusable React components with TypeScript - _Rationale:_ Maintainability and type safety across large government dashboard codebase
- **Reactive Data Architecture:** Convex real-time subscriptions - _Rationale:_ Optimal for dashboard applications requiring live updates and collaborative features
- **API Gateway Pattern:** Convex functions as unified backend interface - _Rationale:_ Centralized authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring for government security
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Real-time updates for dashboard metrics - _Rationale:_ Enables immediate reflection of government project status changes

**Detailed Rationale:**
This high-level architecture addresses the PRD requirements for real-time government project monitoring with AI-powered insights. The microservices approach allows independent scaling of AI prediction services while maintaining data sovereignty. Vercel + Convex provides a modern fullstack platform that can handle 1000+ concurrent users with sub-3 second load times. The external AI hosting maintains modularity and allows for future AI model upgrades without disrupting the core application.

**Trade-offs and Decisions:**
- Chose Vercel over AWS/Azure for superior frontend performance and developer experience
- Selected Convex for its real-time capabilities over traditional REST/GraphQL backends
- Opted for external AI hosting to maintain flexibility in AI model selection
- Prioritized government security requirements in all architectural decisions
